## Bio

##### 4 month ago I decide to start learning javascript and then ReactJS Im currently in the process of building my first project away from tutorials, But I took some time away to join in the Supabase Holiday Hackathon and see what I could build in a few days.

## Tech

- SupaBase
- NextJS
- TailwindCSS
- TailwindUI
- FramerMotion

## How Supabase Was Used?

- Auth Users Have to authenticate to post a joke.
- Realtime likes and dislikes are updated in real time.
- Database stored a table of jokes posted by users
- Remote Procedure Call to increment or decrement the count of a like on a post

## Pointers

The Realtime docs are not beginner friendly as of the time this post and could do with some work
Auth is amazing and easy to set up!
